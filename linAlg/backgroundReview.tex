\chapter{Background \& Review}
\noindent
Everything mentioned in this chapter should already be familiar to you from other math classes.
These topics span two main areas: algebra/pre-calculus and single variable calculus.
Ideas from algebra and pre-calculus will be used either implicitly or with only a passing reference.
Topics from single variable calculus will mostly be used in setting up problems.

\noindent
If you are unfamiliar with anything mentioned, you can use many of the great only resources like Khan Academy, to familiarize yourself before moving forward.
