\begin{example}
Factor the polynomial $x^5 + x^4 -2x^3 + 4x^2 -24x$.	
\end{example}
\begin{answer}
	We can immediately see that there is no constant term, so $x=0$ is a root. Now we need to work on factoring $x^4 + x^3 -2x^2 + 4x - 24$.\\
	The factors of -24 are: -24, -12, -8, -6, -4, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Starting from roots close to 0 and working outwards, we find that $x=2$ is a root. So, we synthetic divide like so
	\begin{table}[H]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{llllll}
			$x=2 \mid$ & 1            & 1 & -2 & 4  & -24 \\
			& $\downarrow$ & 2 & 6  & 8  & 24  \\ \hline
			& 1            & 3 & 4  & 12 & $\mid 0$  
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	\noindent
	to see that now we need to work on factoring $x^3+3x^2+4x+12$.
	$x^3+3x^2+4x+12 = x^2(x+3)+4(x+3) = (x+3)(x^2+4)$, so $x=-3$ is a root, and we need to work on factoring $x^2+4$.
	$x^2+4$ has two complex roots $\pm 2i$, so we'll leave it as a quadratic.
	\begin{equation*}	
		x^5 + x^4 -2x^3 + 4x^2 -24x = x(x-2)(x-3)(x^2+4)
	\end{equation*}
